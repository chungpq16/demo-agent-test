# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI Chatbot for Jira Issue Management

## Overview

This PRD outlines the requirements for an AI Chatbot designed to manage Jira issues using LangChain and Streamlit. The chatbot provides interactive capabilities for listing, analyzing, and categorizing Jira issues, with a user-friendly frontend built in Streamlit.

## Objectives

- Enable users to interact with Jira issues via natural language
- Provide actionable insights and categorization of issues using AI
- Streamline Jira issue management through an intuitive UI

## Features

### 1. AI Agent Integration

- Integrate LangChain to orchestrate AI agent workflows
- Equip the agent with tools for Jira API interaction, data analysis, and summarization

### 2. Streamlit Frontend

- Build a responsive UI using Streamlit
- Support chat-based interactions and display of Jira issue data

### 3. Jira Issue Listing

- Allow users to list Jira issues by status (all, to-do, done, etc.)
- Allow users to retrieve all accessible Jira issues without status filtering
- Present issues in a tabular format for easy review

### 4. Issue Detail Retrieval

- Enable users to request detailed information about specific Jira issues
- Display key fields such as summary, description, status, assignee, labels, and comments

### 5. Issue Analysis & Categorization

- List Jira issues and structure them in a DataFrame
- Use an LLM model to analyze issues based on labels, tags, and similarity
- Provide insights such as common themes, bottlenecks, or priority clusters

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to list Jira issues by status so I can track progress
- As a user, I want to retrieve all accessible Jira issues to get a complete overview
- As a user, I want to view details of a specific issue for deeper understanding
- As a user, I want the chatbot to analyze and categorize issues to identify trends and actionable insights

## Technical Requirements

- LangChain for agent orchestration and tool integration
- Streamlit for frontend development
- Jira API for issue data retrieval
- Pandas for DataFrame structuring
- LLM (OpenAI GPT) for analysis and categorization

## Success Metrics

- Accurate retrieval and display of Jira issues
- Quality and relevance of AI-generated insights
- User satisfaction with chatbot interactions and UI

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Jira Agent** - AI agent for tool orchestration and LLM interaction
2. **Jira Client** - API wrapper for Jira operations
3. **Tools** - Six individual functions for specific operations:
   - Get issues by status
   - Get issue details
   - Get all issues (without status filter)
   - Get all issues for analysis
   - Search issues by JQL
   - Get project summary
4. **Streamlit UI** - Web interface for user interaction
5. **Configuration** - Environment and settings management

### Data Flow

1. User input → Streamlit interface
2. Streamlit → Chatbot → Agent
3. Agent → Tool selection and execution
4. Tools → Jira API calls
5. Results → Agent → Chatbot → Streamlit → User

### Security Considerations

- API tokens stored in environment variables
- No sensitive data logging
- Secure HTTPS connections to Jira

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successfully connect to Jira API
- [ ] List issues by various statuses
- [ ] Retrieve detailed issue information
- [ ] Provide AI-powered analysis and insights
- [ ] Maintain conversational context
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Responsive web interface
